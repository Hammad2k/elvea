            <h1><b>Storyline: </b></h1>
            <br>
            
            <p>Hammur was an elf child who was left in the rubble of his desolated town when the<br> wretched human army attacked, who’s king sought out to eliminate the entire elf race from the land. The king<br> ruled over the land of Elvea, which was stolen from the kingdom of elves after the king’s father, who was a high rank <br>human noble and was close to the Elf king, slowly built up an army, invaded and slayed the Royal elves and took over the throne.  <br><br><br>
                The king was drove to this state of madness after a prophesy by his most trusted wizard <br>was told: that his end will be brought upon by a young elf who will grow up to be strong and defeat him to take <br>his throne for his race to rule the land once again. Predictably, this mad king was furious, and his paranoia drove<br> him to the extent of not just wiping out newborn elf males, but the entire elf race. He knew that this prophesy was a <br>true one because it was the land of the elves, so he saw it only fitting that an elf out of all races would avenge his people and take his rightful place as king to restore the kingdom of elves. <br><br><br>
                Following the aftermath of this attack, a human family from a peasant human town <br>found this elf youngling in a basket, most likely planted from his parents as a last attempt to save <br>their child. Miraculously, Hammur was left without a scratch in this destruction where all the elves were obliterated. 
                The humans took it as a sign that this elf child was special and may be the one to <br>defeat the evil king whom the peasants despised because of his disgust and negligence towards the peasants. This virtuous peasant family took Hammur and treated him as a child of their own. Over the years, the king’s <br>paranoia never quite diminished, he would send his troops to round up families of every town and city monthly and investigate their houses and the areas for hidden elves.<br><br><br>
                The king was offering great prizes to anyone who would find out an elf and report<br> it, this meant that there were many groups of people who would hunt down suspected elves for prizes. Therefore, the peasant family had no choice but to cut off Hammur’s ears to give him the appearance of a small human child, so that he would not have to hide from the human army every time.<br><br>
                The young family even decided to not have their own children so they could put all their <br>power and resources into the development of Hammur, who they were certain was destined to defeat<br> the king. From a walking age, they would teach him sword combat and specialist warrior training, yet he was not allowed to learn and practice his elf magic as the grand wizards and witches of the king would sense the presence of elf magic and would find him, endangering himself and his family. <br><br><br>
                This resulted, from an early age, that Hammur was a young warrior who was unstoppable in <br>combat, not only strong but also durable and mobile due to his size. As a child they would send him on “expeditions”, where they would leave him in a forest to fend for himself for a month, his goal was to defend himself and bring home least 5 heads of the king’s military troops and also meat for the family, this would feed his family for months and they earnt a living from selling this meat in the town.<br><br><br>
                Beginning his teenage years, Hammur was already proficient in combat and was a survival<br> specialist, due to being an elf, compared to humans, he naturally had superior intellect, extraordinary<br> agility and senses. The parents knew he was special, so they regularly sent him out on these expeditions to<br> develop and “battleharden” him. They also told him tales of the wretched king and what he had done not only<br> to his parents, but also the entire elf race, just to keep himself alive.<br><br><br>
                This way Hammur was inherently hateful <br>of the King and it was his own personal goal to defeat the selfish king just as it was the king’s goal<br> to protect himself. Hamur will be the lone wolf searching for answers, he will have to combat monsters that roam the land and the king’s troops. Using his skills and wits, he will overcome each obstacle where he will eventually face the king. He will not stop until he takes the king’s throne. <br><br><br>
